# ✈️ Flight Booking System

## 📌 Java Mini Project

This project is a **Java-based Flight Booking System** developed as a **mini group project** using **core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts**.  
It simulates the basic operations of an airline reservation system through a **console-based application**.

The system supports **user and admin roles**, allowing users to view and book **domestic and international flights**, manage bookings, and handle payments.  
The project emphasizes **clean code structure, modular design, and OOP principles** such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
